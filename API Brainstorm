API ideas below:
Emma:
Popular news topic trends. Database for multiple news websites: https://newsapi.org/
This is my fav. We can see the latest, top and most popular headline lists from over 70 news websites. So, we can analyze the types of 
articles that are being published and perhaps, analyze the trend in the types of articles that people like to read more. I know from somewhere 
that some news apps on our phones track what kinds of articles we tend to click on and analyze that and push more articles of the same kind
to us so we stay on the news app longer. So with the data from the API, we can see what kinds of articles the general public is more 
interested in and how that is changing. 

Search trends on youtube: https://developers.google.com/youtube/?csw=1#data_api
Lots of google api's: https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/platform/
Global warming and natural disaster. Correlation?  Yahoo Weather API: https://developer.yahoo.com/weather/

Jessica:
Nutritionix	Worlds largest verified nutrition database: https://www.nutritionix.com/business/api]
Has 776,360 food items including over 616K grocery foods with barcodes and 134K restaurant foods.
OR
USDA Food Composition Database: https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/doc/index
USDA Nutrients National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference

Facebook API: https://developers.facebook.com
Facebook Login, Share on FB, Social Plugins, Analytics and more

GetHealth API: https://www.programmableweb.com/api/gethealth
Get Health is developer friendly unified REST-based API for fetching data from several health and fitness wearables,
medical devices and monitors. Has data sources from many apps including FitBit and the Apple HealthKit

Alex:

Steam APIs : https://steamcommunity.com/dev (a bunch of data about games and people who play them)
  This API contains information on all the games on steam and their players.

NASA APIs: https://api.nasa.gov/index.html
  Includes many cool APIs such as the Near Earth Objects API which tracks asteroids "near" Earth and
  contains data about their size, mass, distance from Earth, etc. There are also other APIs such as Mars
  Rover Image API but many of them are image APIs which are less useful for us in this project.

PUBG API: https://pubgtracker.com/site-api
  Includes player and game statistics for one of the most popular games on Steam of all time.

World Bank API: https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/889386-developer-information-overview
  My top choice. These APIs contain massive amount of economic and financial data for almost every country on the world for the past
  60 years and it is easily accessible and its data easily recovered (people built libraries for easy access and I tested them). I think
  with this data we can build a project where we analyze global trends, economic or not, for the past 60 years. We can even place two
  countries side by side and compare their growth throughout the past 60 years. We can also access every single World Bank project ever
  conducted or is being conducted if we wanted to.

BTC Blockchain API: https://blockchain.info/api
We could match google trends to the blockchain API to 'predict' it's popularity and price, this method could match things like
other markets to google trends, currencies, or products.

Ticketmaster or Eventbrite APIs: https://www.eventbrite.com/developer/v3/
http://developer.ticketmaster.com/products-and-docs/apis/getting-started/
https://developer.wmata.com/
We could create a site that looks at upcoming events and calculates traffic and city activity. Alternatively, we could create a site
that compiles events and activities and could recommend things to attend for travelers or tourists.

We could compile a few of the job search APIs and make a site that has a sort of advanced search for jobs that match an individuals search terms.
